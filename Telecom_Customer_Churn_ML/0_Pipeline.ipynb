    "## Pipeline for Telecom Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline outlines the key steps for building a machine learning workflow to predict customer churn in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Generation and Collection**\n",
    "   - Collect and generate raw customer data from internal systems, external sources (e.g., data marketplace)\n",
    "   - Collect historical customer data including demographics, usage patterns, billing information, and service details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Ingestion**\n",
    "   - Ingest collected data into the analytics platform (e.g., Databricks, data lake).\n",
    "   - Store ingested data in the Bronze Layer (raw zone) for traceability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**\n",
    "   - Split data into training and test sets before cleaning.\n",
    "   - Perform stratified train-test split to maintain class proportions.\n",
    "   - This approach simulates real-time scenarios where models must handle raw, uncleaned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "   - Handle missing values and outliers.\n",
    "   - Perform outlier detection and capping to reduce the impact of extreme values.\n",
    "   - Standardize data formats and values.\n",
    "   - Compute column statistics (mean, median, std, min, max) for validation and profiling.\n",
    "   - Perform data validation checks to ensure data consistency (schema, datatypes, and null handling).\n",
    "   - Store cleaned data in the Silver Layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Analysis**\n",
    "   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.\n",
    "   - Identify key factors influencing churn and ensure no data leakage from target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Transformation**\n",
    "   - Handle skewness using log transformation or other techniques.\n",
    "   - Apply feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).\n",
    "   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., OneHotEncoding, LabelEncoding).\n",
    "   - Standardize and normalize data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **SMOTE Analysis**\n",
    "   - Apply SMOTE or other resampling techniques to address class imbalance.\n",
    "   - Apply SMOTE only on training set to prevent data leakage and balance classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - Added features (e.g., tenure buckets, contract type indicators).\n",
    "   - Perform feature correlation analysis to identify relationships.\n",
    "   - Drop unnecessary columns based on analysis.\n",
    "   - Evaluate feature importance and ranking (e.g., feature_importances_).\n",
    "   - Reorder features based on importance.\n",
    "   - Assemble features using VectorAssembler.\n",
    "   - Apply StandardScaler to feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Model Training**\n",
    "   - Train multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression (lr) and Random Forest (rf).\n",
    "   - Fit both models on the training data.\n",
    "   - Log training metrics, parameters, and artifacts for both models using MLflow for reproducibility.\n",
    "   - **Generate predictions on test data using both models.**\n",
    "   - **Compare model performance on test data to select the best model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Evaluate model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\n",
    "   - Visualize results with confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **ML Pipeline Construction**\n",
    "    - Build a ML pipeline with only one stage: model training.\n",
    "    - Integrate the training step for the selected model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Model Registry**\n",
    "    - Register the best model in a model registry for versioning and governance.\n",
    "    - Use Databricks MLflow Model Registry for tracking versions, ownership, and deployment readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Model Deployment**\n",
    "    - Deploy the registered model for real-time inference.\n",
    "    - Deploy the model via REST API, Databricks Model Serving, or batch scoring jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Inference Pipeline**\n",
    "    - Use the deployed model to predict churn for new customers.\n",
    "    - Integrate predictions into business workflows.\n",
    "    - Save inference results in Gold Layer tables for business dashboards.\n",
    "    - Monitor data drift and model performance regularly."
